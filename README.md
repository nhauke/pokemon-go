# pokemon-go
Valois Bois Scav Item 85

This is a crappy wrapper around Go with Pokemon in place of all keywords.

The mappings are:

break -> bulbasaur  
case -> charmander  
chan -> chansey  
const -> cloyster  
continue -> clefairy  
default -> ditto  
defer-> diglett  
else -> eevee  
fallthrough -> fearow  
for -> jigglypuff  
func -> flareon  
go -> golduck  
goto -> goldeen  
if -> jynx  
import -> exeggutor  
interface -> ivysaur  
map -> meowth  
package -> pikachu  
range -> rattata  
return -> exeggcute  
select -> snorlax  
struct -> starmie  
switch -> slowpoke  
type -> tentacool  
var -> venusaur  

Usage:  
Convert a Go file to a Pokemon go file: ./pokemon-go convert <file.go> <file.pgo>  
Run: ./pokemon-go run <file.pgo>  
Help: ./pokemon-go help  
Other go commands should also work with their pokemon-go counterpart  
As a feature, pokemon-go also accepts and will run most Go files  
Several test .pgo files have been uploaded in the test directory  
Tested on MacOS X
